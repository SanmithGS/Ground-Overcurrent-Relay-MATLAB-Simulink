#  Ground Overcurrent Relay  – Simulink Protection Model

Ground fault detection and selective isolation using an **Inverse Time Overcurrent Relay ** built in **MATLAB Simulink**.

---

##  What I Built
- 3-phase feeder (Bus A → Line → Bus B → Loads)
- Ground fault simulation
- Residual current (Ia+Ib+Ic) based relay logic
- Inverse time delay tripping
- Automatic breaker isolation
- Relay trip time ≈ **0.44 s**

---

##  Tools
MATLAB Simulink • Simscape Electrical

---

##  Results

**Bus A – Source**
- Fault → current surge  
- Relay trip → current cleared  

**Bus B – Load**
- Voltage collapse during fault  
- Load isolated after trip  

---

##  Run
Open `.slx` → Run → Trigger fault → Observe trip

---

##  Skills Demonstrated
Power System Protection • Relay Coordination • Fault Analysis • Simulink Modeling
